# Canvas RPG

## About
This project has been pieced together to be an engine for a top-down RPG that renders on a canvas tag. It is in no working order at the moment, but it has been fun to piece together.

## Contributing
Feel free to fork it if you want, but I make no promises on the commenting/logic of the code at the moment. If you add to it I will definitely accept pull requests.
